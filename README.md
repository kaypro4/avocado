## Synopsis

This is a Drupal 7 site configured for use by non-profit boards to track minutes, action items and votes related to board meetings.  The site uses organic groups so that many boards can use the same installation but stay insulated from one and other.  This is not a document tracking system.  Best to use something like Google Drive for that.  

## Motivation

There was nothing that I could find that met the board activity tracking needs of a small non-profit organization.  

## Installation

You'll need the script to set up the mySQL database in addition to these source files. Please contact me if you'd like the database.  I won't bother scrubbing the version I have unless there is interest.  

## License

This code is released under the licenses that cover the components.
